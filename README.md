# Temperature Conversion

### Instructions:
 
- Create a well-named Python function that does the following: 
  - This should be a void function that is passed the temperature in Celsius as an argument, converts that temperature to Fahrenheit and prints its value 
- Create a well-named Python function that does the following: 
  - This should be a value returning function that is passed the temperature in Fahrenheit as an argument, converts that temperature to Celsius and returns its value 
- Create and call a function named main() that does the following: 
  - Prompts the user to enter the temperature 
  - Asks the user if the temperature has been entered in Fahrenheit or Celsius 
  - If the temperature was entered in Fahrenheit, the program should call the correct function to convert and print the equivalent value in Celsius. 
  - If the temperature was entered in Celsius, the program should call the correct function to convert and print the equivalent value in Fahrenheit 
  - If an invalid value is entered an error message should be displayed and the user should be asked to enter valid data. The program should not end or attempt to convert the temperature until valid input has been entered. 
- 	Enter your name, the lab number, and the current date into a set of comments at the top of the code.      
- Push the program source code to the assignment repo.
